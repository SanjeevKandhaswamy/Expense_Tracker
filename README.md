# Expense_Tracker

This is a simple project to track the expenses that have been incurred by the user.
This project has both - a local Database that stores Data locally(Excel) and a cloud base (Firebase).
This project can implement a bar chart and a pie chart for the expenses that have been incurred based on the Category of spending the spend comes down to.

There will be a lot to build on in the future as this project was done in about 3 hours.

PS: This project needs a json file that has the firebase credentials to help the program access firebase. The json file was not included for reasons that should be apparent by now.
